<h5>What is the SST-NP Integrated Diploma Programme (IDP)?</h5>
<p>The SST-Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) IDP is a through-train programme <strong>from SST to Ngee Ann Polytechnic Year 1</strong>.
IDP students will spend 2 years (Secondary 3 and 4) in SST before progressing

<p>With time freed up from the preparation for and sitting for the GCE O-Level
Examination, many of the subjects would be taught differently to enhance
the Integrated and Applied Learning experiences. There are also opportunities
to partner STEM industry and community experts to extend students’ learning
in real world contexts. These experiences will include various levels of
engagement such as work experience and internship opportunities, mentorship
to guide students in their IDP Capstone Project, customised learning journeys
and advanced elective modules.</p>
<h5>What are the criteria/ requirements to enrol in IDP?</h5>
<p>Students should demonstrate disposition in Science and Mathematics and
a proclivity for applied learning. The overall academic results and teachers’
feedback regarding their attitude and aptitude towards applied learning
during STEM programmes and performance tasks will also be part of the criteria.</p>
<h5>What is the selection process for IDP?</h5>
<p>Secondary 2 students who are interested to join the IDP should indicate
their interest via the self-nomination form given to them before their
End-of-Year Examination. Besides self-nomination, students will also be
selected based on their academic performance and teachers’ recommendation.
Selected students will be issued a letter of offer to confirm their commitment
to the programme.</p>
