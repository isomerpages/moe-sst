### Curriculum Matters

###### How is SST’s curriculum different from other secondary schools?
SST offers a range of Applied Subjects to all students. The Applied Subjects are reflected in the GCE O-Level Examination Certificate and are recognised for admission into local Junior Colleges and Polytechnics. Applied subjects include Biotechnology, Computing+, Design Studies and Electronics. Biotechnology and Design Studies are exclusive to SST. Students can also opt to take up two Applied Subjects, Computing+ and Electronics, under the Engineering+ programme.

The collaboration with SST partners such as the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Ngee Ann Polytechnic, and leading companies such as 3M and Apple Inc. provide additional learning opportunities, attachments, and enrichment programmes in applied areas for the students.
