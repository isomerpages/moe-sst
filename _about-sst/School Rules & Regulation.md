##### 1. SCHOOL ATTIRE 

The uniform distinguishes the SST students who should wear it with pride and loyalty for the school they have chosen to be part of. The uniform must be clean, neatly pressed with no tears or frayed areas. The overall appearance of an SST student should be smart and neat.

Modification of the school uniform is not allowed and is to be worn as prescribed.

Students are expected to be punctual and present physically at the stipulated time and venue for all classes, CCA sessions, examinations and all other school-organised activities. Wilful absenteeism is a serious offence.
