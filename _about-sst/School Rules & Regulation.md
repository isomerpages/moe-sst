##### Student Management in SST

SST works to build a positive culture and healthy relationships in the school. Character-based in its approach to discipline, rules and regulations are established to develop self management, moral reasoning, and a generalised respect for others. The school has a responsibility to take appropriate disciplinary action for inappropriate behaviour. Its restorative practices allow students to make restitution and reintegrate in the community. In recalcitrant cases and serious offences, the school reserves the right to take further actions including caning, probation, suspension or expulsion. The school also reserves the right to amend or add rules and regulations pertaining to discipline from time to time.
