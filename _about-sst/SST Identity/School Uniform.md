Students need a variety of attires for different activities. Prior to joining SST, the pioneer cohort was given the opportunity to vote for their preferred school uniform. The final designs were selected based on the votes and the schoolâ€™s requirements.

#### Uniform (2009)

In an active applied learning environment, where students are always on the move, the choice of the Polo T-Shirt, Long pants for boys and Culottes/Skorts for girls, allows students to be presentable yet comfortable.

#### Sports and Wellness Attire (2009)

The uniform comes in 5 versions to represent the House colours.

They are Black, Yellow, Blue, Red and Green. These colours are in reference to the five colours of the Olympic Rings.

Students are assigned their specific Houses when they enter SST in Secondary 1 and remain in the House throughout their journey in SST.

#### School Blazer (2010)

During formal school events and external competitions, SST students will wear the blazer and tie.

#### School Jacket (2012)

The school jacket helps to keep the students comfortable during local and overseas excursions and serves as a means of identification. It can be worn over the SST Polo T-Shirt.

#### School Bermudas (2020)

The introduction of the school bermudas for male students provided an additional option for comfort in view of the weather conditions in Singapore and climate change. Male students will be allowed to wear the bermudas, instead of long pants, together with their SST polo T-shirt as part of the school uniform on any school day, except Mondays, formal school and external events.
