The designing of the school flag started as a post-exam activity run by the Student Development Department back in 2011.

During the process of looking for brand elements that would be on the flag, the 6 sided polygon, the Hexagon, was selected as a symbol that best represented the school. This shape was chosen as a secondary element and brand identity in the form of ‘The Hexagons’ to symbolise the learning and development process, en route to building a solid educational foundation.

The final flag was revealed at the permanent campus at 1 Technology Drive on 3 January 2012.
