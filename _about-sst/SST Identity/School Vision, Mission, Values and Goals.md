<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>A globally connected institution dedicated to transforming learning</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To nurture passionate innovators who apply knowledge of science and technology,
guided by the spirit of the humanities for a better world</p>
<h3>Values</h3>
<h5>Forging Excellence</h5>
<p>Members of the SST community will embark on every endeavour with passion,
commitment, confidence and courage; and a belief that our best efforts
will bring about positive outcomes for the common good, whilst developing
excellence in personal work ethics and character. SST is an organization
where people care about and work towards being the best they can be, both
personally and at the organizational and community levels.</p>
<h5>Building an Empowered Community</h5>
<p>In SST, we shall build ourselves and others, in every interaction and
decision we make, and through respect and responsibility, live our espoused
shared values with a sense of efficacy and desire to improve. We shall
empower ourselves and others with positive thoughts to explore what is
possible and to bring SST to greater heights. We will contribute to constructing
the future world that we will inhabit and make it better for generations
to come. We will take responsibility of and care for the SST and larger
community beyond.</p>
<h5>Expanding Learning Networks</h5>
<p>SST is an ecological entity unto itself, where individuals with diverse
interests, talents and world-views converge as a learning community, and
where everyone is interdependent and actively leverages the diversity to
share knowledge and build collective wisdom. SST is positioned to be a
forerunner in learning on the Information and Communication Technology
(ICT) platform, and in leading the way for learning communities in Singapore
and beyond.</p>
