A group of students from the pioneer cohort volunteered to write the school song under the direction of the respective teachers-in-charge. The team held various discussions with the school leaders to single out key messages, metaphors and concepts. It was decided that the song should include the school’s vision, mission and goals.

The final theme selected was centred on the words: “Transforming Learning, Impacting Society”. The final version of the song emerged in March 2013.
