The SST logo was designed by the legendary Logo King, Berwin See (1961 – 2009).

The red ‘S’ symbolises the vibrancy of the school culture and the vitality of students and staff. The grey interlocking ‘S’ and ‘T’ represents the integrated nature of the theoretical knowledge of science and its application to technology. The three blocks extending from the letter ‘T’ represents the close collaboration of the school and our stakeholders.

The SST colour palette consists of three colours: SST Blue, SST Red and SST Grey. These colours reflect SST’s vibrant personality.
