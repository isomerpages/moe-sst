##### What is the SST-NP Integrated Diploma Programme (IDP)?
The SST-Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) IDP is a through-train programme **from SST to Ngee Ann Polytechnic Year 1**. IDP students will spend 2 years (Secondary 3 and 4) in SST before progressing to NP to pursue one of its 21 STEM-related diploma programmes.

##### What is unique about the IDP curriculum?
IDP students do not need to take the GCE O-Level examination with the exception of Mother Tongue Language which is a national requirement. 

With time freed up from the preparation for and sitting for the GCE O-Level Examination, many of the subjects would be taught differently to enhance the Integrated and Applied Learning experiences. There are also opportunities to partner STEM industry and community experts to extend students’ learning in real world contexts. These experiences will include various levels of engagement such as work experience and internship opportunities, mentorship to guide students in their IDP Capstone Project, customised learning journeys and advanced elective modules.

##### What are the criteria/ requirements to enrol in IDP? 
Students should demonstrate disposition in Science and Mathematics and a proclivity for applied learning. The overall academic results and teachers’ feedback regarding their attitude and aptitude towards applied learning during STEM programmes and performance tasks will also be part of the criteria.

##### What is the selection process for IDP?
Secondary 2 students who are interested to join the IDP should indicate their interest via the self-nomination form given to them before their End-of-Year Examination. Besides self-nomination, students will also be selected based on their academic performance and teachers’ recommendation. Selected students will be issued a letter of offer to confirm their commitment to the programme.

##### Can external candidates apply for IDP?
Currently, the SST-NP IDP is only for SST students.

##### What is the school fee per month?
IDP and mainstream students on the IDP pay the same fees.
