#### Integrated Diploma Programme

##### What is the SST-NP Integrated Diploma Programme (IDP)?
The SST-Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) IDP is a through-train programme from SST to Ngee Ann Polytechnic Year 1. IDP students will spend 2 years (Secondary 3 and 4) in SST before progressing to NP to pursue one of its twenty STEM diploma programmes.

##### What is the IDP curriculum?
IDP students do not need to take the GCE O Level examination with the exception of Mother Tongue Language / Higher Mother Tongue Language which is a national requirement. 

With time freed up from the preparation for and sitting for the GCE O Level Examination, many of the subjects would be taught differently to enhance the Applied Learning experience. There would be more interdisciplinary and extension-of-learning opportunities. 


##### What are the criteria/ requirements for my child to enrol in IDP?
IDP is suited for students who demonstrate disposition in Science and Mathematics and a proclivity for applied learning. The overall academic results and teachersâ€™ feedback regarding their attitude and aptitude towards applied learning during STEM programmes and performance tasks will also be part of the criteria.

##### How do I apply for the IDP?
Secondary 2 students who are interested to join the IDP should indicate their interest on the self-nomination form given to them before their End-of-Year Examination. Students who have self-nominated and who meet the eligibility criteria will be given a letter of offer to confirm their commitment to the programme.

##### Can external candidates apply for IDP?
Currently, the SST-NP IDP is only for SST students.

##### What is the school fee per month?
Students on the IDP and the O level Programme pay the same fees. Click [here](https://www.sst.edu.sg/student-admission/school-fees/) for more information.

##### Do students get credits or be able to skip some modules for the NP diploma course?
IDP students who obtained a grade of A2 or better in the SST-IDP Integrated Math subject will be exempted from Engineering Mathematics 1 module if they choose to pursue a course in NP School of Engineering.

##### Do IDP students need to take the GCE O Level Examination? 
IDP students do not need to take the GCE O Level Examination with the exception of Mother Tongue Language / Higher Mother Tongue Language, which is a national requirement. 

##### How are students assessed in the SST-NP IDP Programme?
IDP students would be assessed through school-based assessments and must obtain at least a pass for their capstone project when in Secondary 4.
