### Financial Matters

##### Will financial aid be available to students from low-income families in SST for them to purchase their own learning devices?

MOE has financial assistance schemes to help needy students.

Students (Singapore Citizens) who successfully gain admission into Secondary One at SST may apply for the MOE Independent School Bursary (ISB) as well as the UPLIFT Scholarship that recognizes the achievements of students in Independent Schools who have performed well academically or in specific talents areas and are from lower-income families.

From 2021, all Secondary 1 students who are Singapore citizens will be able to utilize the funds in their Edusave account to offset the cost for their Personal Learning Device. Students who are Singapore citizens from lower-income families will enjoy further subsidies for the purchase.

##### Are there any scholarships or financial assistance for eligible students?

Similar to the other independent schools, the Government will provide financial assistance to ensure that the fees payable by Singaporean students are affordable.
