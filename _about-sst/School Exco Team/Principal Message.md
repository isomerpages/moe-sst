**Welcome to the School of Science and Technology, Singapore (SST)!**

##### **_SST, an institution where we create our exciting story together._**

The SST story is one that is full of inspiration and excitement and brings fond memories to the SST family. Applied Learning (AL) is our way of life as we strive to **nurture passionate innovators who apply knowledge of science and technology*, guided by the spirit of the humanities for a better world**. Being one of a kind, these are philosophies, which are deeply ingrained in whatever we do in SST. In fact, Applied Learning, Science and Technology are the very existential fundamentals for the establishment of SST.  How do we breathe life into the disciplines and connect them together to create betterment for human life?

How are critical and innovative thinking nurtured through this unique curriculum, which SST offers? All these are the quintessential traits of SST education which aims to be **a globally connected institution dedicated to transforming learning**.

In our quest to transforming learning, students and teachers will co-create and co-develop the evolving answers to that as the world is changing. Flexible and independent learning with collaborative teamwork will be critical as we prepare our students to be self-directed learners.  Our students are poised to take on the world as leaders of the future. In SST, the 21st Century Competencies explicated as the 10Cs (Critical Thinking, Creativity, Curiosity, Collaboration, Communication, Citizenship, Cross-cultural understanding, Confidence, Commitment, and Courage) are regarded as dispositions and skills that support the attainment of SST’s goals and this forms the foundation for our SST education. 

##### Imagine the joy you get when you see how things work and how knowledge comes to life.  
Imagine the deeper meaning you realise in what you have learnt and created. Now you can make that connection of your learning to something tangible and authentic in the future._**

Applied Learning and integrated learning are the bedrock of our distinctive curriculum. That is the theory-practice nexus and its relevance, which we hope our students would appreciate in what they have learnt from SST. School life should be vibrant and mind-stimulating and triggers deep thinking. With a voracious curiosity, our SST students would embark on a journey of discovery and pursuit of new possibilities.  In turn, they would have an insatiable appetite for new knowledge and skills and be better poised to take on the world. Learning is no longer linear and we need to have a curious and learn-for-life mindset and attitude. As the saying goes, “the world is your oyster” and that new age is now dawning.

##### Our goal is to recognise, nurture, and enhance the development of those talents by providing educational experiences that will allow our SST students to pursue their interests and fulfil their greatest potential.

As an institution, we always keep an eye on the challenges and opportunities of today and tomorrow. Every SST student is a talent to be nurtured to its fullest potential. At SST, our students are nurtured to be passionate innovators who improve our society through real-world applications of science and technology. Furthermore, they would learn beyond borders and connect with other students beyond Singapore and make sense and solve world issues together. As we push the frontiers in transforming learning, our SST curriculum prepares our students to become leaders in various fields they embarked on.

Over in SST, we value the students’ role in decision-making and change efforts of their own school. We do this through emphasis of student voice, which herein, encourages reflection, discussion, dialogue and action on matters that concern the student population, by implication, the school staff and the community that SST serves. Through student agency and advocacy, SST students would be able to articulate their views, co-design and see through positive changes that encourage various forms of overt student leadership. This will foster a personal drive and mission, giving them a strong sense of purpose in life.  

Furthermore, we believe firmly in cultivating and sustaining active partnerships with families and the community to support the growth of our students. Our team of caring teachers works closely with parents to guide student learning and development. We also harness and expand our learning networks beyond physical boundaries and constantly seek to discover and seek new partnerships. Such strong Partners-in-Education, local and overseas, will help to value-add to the learning experiences for the entire SST community. Our closest affiliated partners, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), together with our industry partners and tertiary institutions, provide invaluable experts-in-field insights and support.

To conclude, we strive to inspire our SST students to dare to dream – and become budding innovators and future-makers – that is what we hope to see in our students. The future is bound to be more complex and we must prepare our youth not just to adapt, but also to ride on the waves of opportunities that it brings.  This would require transforming and designing innovative methods of teaching and learning to develop agile learners with not just deep expertise, but also the disposition to learn-for-life and enact positive changes in society.

Lastly, thank you to all past Principals for their stewardship, especially Mrs Linda Chan (Principal/ SST, 2016-2021) and Mrs Chew Wai Lee (Vice-Principal/ SST, 2009-2021) for their immense contribution and service to SST. As One SST Team, we will continue to build on top of the good work done by previous leaderships.

Together, we will help your children discover themselves, explore their interests and talents, and realise their aspirations.

Stay Curious and Dare to Dream!
