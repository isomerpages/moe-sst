The Design Studies course equips students with knowledge and skills of the design field through design thinking, design process and fundamentals of three design disciplines: visual communication design, interior and exhibition space design, and architectural design. The course aims to nurture an awareness and appreciation of the positive relationships among design, humanity, art, technology, business, culture and economic development. As such, it cultivates an awareness of the role of design in shaping one’s experience of visual communication, space, objects and the environment.

Students will develop creative and innovative mindsets, critical thinking and analytical skills through design activities; and acquire the ability to critique design works and generate creative design solutions. Students will also acquire competencies in visual and oral expression and communication, as well as digital design techniques for presenting design concepts. Design projects foster students’ responsibility, confidence and sense of efficacy.
