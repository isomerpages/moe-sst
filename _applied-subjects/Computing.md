The Computing+ course in SST equips students with computational thinking and creativity to analyse and solve problems. Computational thinking is a problem-solving process involving analysis, pattern finding, abstraction and algorithmic design. Students use these processes to develop programmes to deal confidently with complex and open-ended problems.

Students who learn computing can apply the thinking skills across the curriculum and begin to see a relationship between subjects as well as real-life applications beyond the classroom. For example, they may use their skills to figure out the rules for binomial expressions, map the entire human DNA experience or analyse a poem in the study of metre and rhythm, tone and diction.

Computing+ is an applied subject taken in the upper secondary. Students from SST are further challenged beyond the O-Level Computing curriculum through additional (+) modules.Â
