**All students take up an Applied Subject in SST.**

SST offers a range of O-Level applied subjects to cover different interests and these subjects are recognised for admission to Junior Colleges or Polytechnic.

The O-Level applied subjects offered in SST are: Biotechnology, Computing+, Design Studies and Electronics.Â Students can also opt to take up two Applied Subjects, Computing + and Electronics, under the Engineering + programme. The school will continue to explore with MOE and the tertiary partners to offer other applied subjects in years to come.
