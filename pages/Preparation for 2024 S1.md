###### 1.1  Personal Learning Device (PLD)

School of Science and Technology, Singapore (SST) is a one-to-one school where every student uses a PLD for their learning. The PLD can be used with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – and other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.

The school has arranged for parents/guardians to purchase the PLD from a vendor for their child/ward’s use in school. The vendor has been identified based on the choice of the device determined by the school from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE. 

**Please recheck this page on 9 Dec to view the recorded briefing on PLD purchase.**

SST will advise all students regarding the purchase of their PLD at a later date.
