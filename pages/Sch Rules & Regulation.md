As members of the community, they are expected to be guided and live by the operative values (4R’s of SST) to contribute to a positive culture where they will look out for the well-being of their peers. Mindful practice of the 4Rs will also enable SST students to be their best selves at all times whilst strengthening their performance and moral character.
