<p><strong>Vehicle safety at the linkway drop-off point</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>During drop-off, parents are urged to stop as near towards Block D as
possible so as not to hold up traffic behind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For parents’ own safety and that of their children, parents are reminded
to drive towards Block D after dropping off their children before doing
a U-turn, instead of doing a 3-point turn at the parking lot areas as this
may again hold back traffic and increase the possibility of an accident.</p>
</li>
</ul>
