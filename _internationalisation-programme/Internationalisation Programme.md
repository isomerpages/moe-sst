In an increasingly interconnected and interdependent global landscape, a well conceived and implemented internationalisation programme is critical to ensure that both SST students and staff grow and thrive in a borderless and globalised world. Internationalisation@SST aims to ensure that students and staff develop a deepened and heightened understanding and awareness of global issues and cultures through various forms and tiers of interaction between our students/staff and their overseas counterparts. The programme equips students with global knowledge and awareness which will enable them to humanely harness innovation and technology to solve societal challenges at home and beyond. By bringing ‘SST to the World’ and the ‘World to SST’, our comprehensive internationalisation programme will ensure that SST grows as a globally connected institution, committed to transforming learning and using science and technology for the betterment of the world.
