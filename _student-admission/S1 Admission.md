### SST SECONDARY 1 (S1) ADMISSION

SST admits all our Secondary 1 students into Posting Group 3 through the Direct School Admission Secondary (DSA-Sec) exercise. **It does not participate in the MOE Secondary One Posting Exercise.** 

**Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.**

**Students successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.**




Applicants not studying in MOE mainstream primary schools must apply for a Registration Number (REG) from MOE Customer Service Centre before applying through the DSA-Sec Portal. Please refer to [https://go.gov.sg/nmsdsa-sec-application ](https://go.gov.sg/nmsdsa-sec-application )for additional information. 


For more information on DSA-Sec, please refer to the MOE website at [https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec](https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec)
