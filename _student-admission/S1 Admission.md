### SST SECONDARY 1 (S1) ADMISSION

SST admits all our Secondary 1 students into the Express Course of study through the Direct School Admission Secondary (DSA-Sec) exercise. **It does not participate in the MOE Secondary One Posting Exercise.** 

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.

#### (A) SST Phase 1 Written Test (Only for shortlisted candidates)

The SST phase 1 Written Test assesses candidates’ ability to solve real-world problems through the application of STEM knowledge and skills. The duration of the test is about 1 hour and 30 min.  All applicants will be informed of the test date and timing via email.

#### (B) SST Phase 2 STEAM Challenge (Only for shortlisted candidates)

The SST phase 2 STEAM Challenge is an activity-based assessment where candidates will work in groups to solve real-world issues. Shortlisted applicants will be informed of the test date and timing via email.

#### (C) Release of DSA-Sec Application Outcome

All applicants will receive the outcome of their application **via email** at the end of the DSA-Sec Exercise. Applicants posted through the DSA-Sec Exercise are also not permitted to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results.
