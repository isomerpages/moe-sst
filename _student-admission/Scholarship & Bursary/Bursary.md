^ GGAS fee comprises school fee, standard miscellaneous fee and maximum 2nd tier miscellaneous fee payable by Singapore Citizen students studying in GGAS. &nbsp;For 2020, the GGAS fee is $25 per month or $300 per year (in secondary level).

\*There will be no reimbursement of expenses incurred by students for the purchase of textbooks and/or school attire prior to the approval of the MOE ISB.

**UPLIFT Scholarship**

With effect from 1 April 2019, MOE has introduced the&nbsp;[UPLIFT Scholarship](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/awards-scholarships/uplift-scholarships)&nbsp;to recognise the achievements of students in Independent Schools who have performed well academically or in specific talents areas, and are from lower-income families.

The UPLIFT Scholarship is awarded to students who are:

1.  Singapore Citizens attending Independent Schools;
2.  Admitted to the school through Direct School Admission or qualified for the Edusave Scholarships for Independent Schools; and
3.  From families with gross monthly household income (GHI) ≤ $3,000, or monthly per capita income (PCI) ≤ $750 (PCI = GHI divided by the number of household members). &nbsp;(Note: these students qualify for 100% fee subsidy under the Independent School Bursary (ISB)).

ISB recipients receiving 100% fee subsidy will be auto-awarded the UPLIFT Scholarship. To apply, please submit the completed ISB application form and all relevant documents to the school.

Students who require additional financial assistance may approach the school. You may call the General Office (Tel: 6571 7200) for enquiry or clarification.
