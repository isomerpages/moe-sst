<h4>GROUP PERSONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE FOR STUDENTS</h4>
<p>The school has taken up a Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance for
all students with Income Insurance limited. The GPA Insurance provides
coverage for students against accidents related to all school programmes
and activities, including Co-Curriculum Activities and sports, both in
and out of school, be it local or abroad. This is in line with the Ministry
of Education’s safety requirements. The policy is by no means extensive
and is intended to help defray some of the medical costs incurred in the
event of an accident.</p>
