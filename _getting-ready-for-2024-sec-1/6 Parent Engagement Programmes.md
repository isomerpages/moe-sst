A series of Parents Engagement Sessions (as part of the Digital Citizenship Programme) has been planned for parents to provide their children with the necessary support and guidance when they embark on their 1-to-1 ICT-enabled learning in SST. Parents of S1 students are strongly encouraged to attend the sessions as an induction to their childrenâ€™s learning environment.

More information to be released in December.
