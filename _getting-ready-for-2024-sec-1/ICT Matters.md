#### 2. ICT Matters For Students And Parents

##### 2.1 Email Account
All SST students are assigned an official email account for communication and access to learning resources during their study. The official email account will be used for all correspondence between the school and students. The login information (ID and Password) will be emailed to parents once available.

##### 2.2 	Students’ Blog

The students’ blog serves as a platform to communicate announcements and general information to students.

Students may refer to the blog regularly to keep abreast of school updates. In addition, students can also download the app “SST Announcer” on their mobile phones. The app enables updates to be pushed to the users.

##### 2.3 Digital Communications

The school website, [www.sst.edu.sg](http://www.sst.edu.sg), is the general portal for communication to the public. 

For SST parents, we have planned the following channels of communication: 

A Principal’s letter will be sent via the [Parents Gateway](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/) at the start of every school term (Week 2) and end of every school semester to inform you of SST’s current activities and future events regularly. The Parents Gateway is a new digital platform developed by the Ministry of Education and GovTech to bring greater convenience to parents to perform simple administrative transactions and to stay updated on schools’ programmes and activities. Parents who do not have access to Parents Gateway may email [ssd@sst.edu.sg](mailto:ssd@sst.edu.sg) for information regarding the onboarding procedure.

##### 2.4 SST Official Social Media Platforms

For regular updates on our students,  school events and achievements, follow our official social media platforms: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ssts.1technologydrive/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SSTSingapore?lang=en), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/SSTSingapore).

##### 2.5 Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

The AUP is intended to prescribe effective, ethical and lawful use of ICT resources by students and ensure a conducive and safe virtual environment in our learning community. This policy applies to the use of the ICT resources owned and managed by SST, as well as those brought in for use by students in SST. All students are to comply with this policy. 

Students and parents will be briefed about the terms of AUP during the Secondary 1 Orientation and Parent Engagement Session, respectively. Parents are encouraged to go through the AUP with the students before accepting the AUP in electronic form.
