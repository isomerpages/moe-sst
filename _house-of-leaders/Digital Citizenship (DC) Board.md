<p>The DCB leadership track programme of SST offers students the opportunity
to develop their leadership skills and become empathetic digital citizens.Through
SST's unique applied learning approach and innovative use of technology,
we seek to connect our students’ hands, heads and hearts so that they will
be engaged learners in the present and become empathetic digital citizens
and leaders in the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Secondary 2, students who show potential in digital citizenship will
be invited to join the Junior Digital Citizenship Leader (jDCL) programme,
where they will have the opportunity to develop their leadership skills
and be invested as Digital Citizenship Leaders (DCLs) in upper secondary.</p>
<p>As DCLs and jDCLs, students will play an important role in promoting positive
online and offline behaviour and upholding SST's zero-tolerance policy
against cyberbullying. They will be actively involved in organising and
engaging the school community through various programmes in the school
year. This includes the Secondary 1 Orientation, Parents Engagement, Digital
Citizenship Week, Secondary One Student Initiated Learning (SIL), Secondary
Two Student Advocacy Project, Secondary Three Digital Inquiry, Secondary
Four Technology Innovation and Ethics, and community outreach activities.</p>

<h5>Executive Committee</h5>
<p>The EXCO will be made up of a chairperson, two vice-chairpersons and two
EXCO members. They embrace SST’s school values and be the role model for
all board members. The responsibilities of the EXCO include providing leadership
in spearheading various initiatives and working closely with the teachers
to ensure successful implementation of the board’s events.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Board Members</h5>
<p>Board members will provide mentorship to the jDCLs and DCRs and be good
role models and advocates for digital citizenship. They will also be involved
in the planning and implementation of the various events.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Junior Board Members</h5>
<p>The jDCB are Secondary 2 students who demonstrated the potential to contribute
to the DCB. They will understudy the DCLs in the planning and implementation
of the various events so as to gain the experience to take up greater responsibilities
when they are promoted to Secondary 3.</p>
<h5>Digital Citizenship Representatives (DCRs)</h5>
<p>There are to be two to three DCRs from each class. These DCRs are not
officially invested into the board, but they will be provided with training
by or with the DCLs. DCRs who demonstrate commitment and leadership potential
will be invited to apply for membership in the DCB when they are in secondary
two. They will take charge of digital citizenship-related matters in their
classes and work with the board members on their digital citizenship projects.</p>
