The DCB leadership track programme of SST offers students the opportunity to develop their leadership skills and become empathetic digital citizens.Through SST's unique applied learning approach and innovative use of technology, we seek to connect our students’ hands, heads and hearts so that they will be engaged learners in the present and become empathetic digital citizens and leaders in the community. 

At Secondary 2, students who show potential in digital citizenship will be invited to join the Junior Digital Citizenship Leader (jDCL) programme, where they will have the opportunity to develop their leadership skills and be invested as Digital Citizenship Leaders (DCLs) in upper secondary.

  As DCLs and jDCLs, students will play an important role in promoting positive online and offline behaviour and upholding SST's zero-tolerance policy against cyberbullying. They will be actively involved in organising and engaging the school community through various programmes in the school year. This includes the Secondary 1 Orientation, Parents Engagement, Digital Citizenship Week, Secondary One Student Initiated Learning (SIL), Secondary Two Student Advocacy Project, Secondary Three Digital Inquiry, Secondary Four Technology Innovation and Ethics, and community outreach activities.

##### Executive Committee
    
The EXCO will be made up of a chairperson, two vice-chairpersons and two EXCO members. They embrace SST’s school values and be the role model for all board members. The responsibilities of the EXCO include providing leadership in spearheading various initiatives and working closely with the teachers to ensure successful implementation of the board’s events. 
 
#####   Board Members
    
Board members will provide mentorship to the jDCLs and DCRs and be good role models and advocates for digital citizenship. They will also be involved in the planning and implementation of the various events. 

##### Junior Board Members
    
The jDCB are Secondary 2 students who demonstrated the potential to contribute to the DCB. They will understudy the DCLs in the planning and implementation of the various events so as to gain the experience to take up greater responsibilities when they are promoted to Secondary 3.

##### Digital Citizenship Representatives (DCRs)
    
There are to be two to three DCRs from each class. These DCRs are not officially invested into the board, but they will be provided with training by or with the DCLs. DCRs who demonstrate commitment and leadership potential will be invited to apply for membership in the DCB when they are in secondary two. They will take charge of digital citizenship-related matters in their classes and work with the board members on their digital citizenship projects.
