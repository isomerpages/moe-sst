<p>PSB strives to foster bonds and build a sense of belonging to the school
community.</p>
<p>In nurturing a caring school environment, Peer Support Leaders (PSL) encourage
a culture of positive relationships with one another by advocating for
well-being and role-modelling good character. PSLs welcome new Secondary
One students to the SST Family and facilitate their transition to secondary
school life. The Secondary One Orientation helps to establish a close-knitted
community, built upon a strong foundation of friendship and support amongst
the new students. To contribute to a caring and appreciative school environment,
PSB helms an annual tradition of showing gratitude to the staff in SST
who have supported the studentsâ€™ well-being and learning.</p>
