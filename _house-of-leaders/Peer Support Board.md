PSB strives to foster bonds and build a sense of belonging to the school community. 

In nurturing a caring school environment, Peer Support Leaders (PSL) encourage a culture of positive relationships with one another by advocating for well-being and role-modelling good character.  PSLs welcome new Secondary One students to the SST Family and facilitate their transition to secondary school life. The Secondary One Orientation helps to establish a close-knitted community, built upon a strong foundation of friendship and support amongst the new students. To contribute to a caring and appreciative school environment, PSB helms an annual tradition of showing gratitude to the staff in SST who have supported the studentsâ€™ well-being and learning.
