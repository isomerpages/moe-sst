<p>The Active Citizenship Education (ACE) curriculum plays a pivotal role
in fostering SSTudents to become global and local active citizens who contribute
to the betterment of the community through,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>advocating positive social action and serving the community with purpose
and enthusiasm;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>displaying the attributes that will allow them to take advantage of the
myriad of opportunities abroad;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seeking to interact with and learn from people from diverse cultural backgrounds;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing respect and empathy for others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the vision of developing a community engaged in active citizenship
and being transformed by service-learning, the ACE committee leads a 4
year ACE curriculum for every SSTudent to undergo applied learning experiences
in the area of Service Learning, National Education Cultural exchanges
with SST’s overseas educational partners and on.</p>
<p>The most passionate SStudents can look forward to taking up the challenge
of being ACE student leaders, who guide and role-model the competencies
of an Active local and global citizen to the SST community.</p>
<p>Through experiential learning and reflective practice across numerous
local service projects in partnership with local organisations such as
Heartware Network, and Singapore Cancer Society or through collaborations
with our international partners through the Learning Alliance Beyond Borders
programme, the ACE curriculum develops Citizenship, Cross-cultural understanding
and Courage from SST’s 10Cs.</p>
<p>Being a school that forges ahead in educational technologies, the ACE
Student Leaders also seeks to engage the community in advocating for social
good through their Instagram account SST-Actvocates at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sstactvocates/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/sstactvocates/</a>
