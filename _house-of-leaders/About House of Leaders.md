Pioneer Batch of Student Leaders (2013)


***

SST Student Leadership Boards were set up in 2012 when the first batch of students were in their 3rd year, with the goal of developing leadership competencies and inspiring students to build a culture of ownership, collaboration and community in the classroom and beyond. In the inaugural year, two boards were established: Student Council and Peer Support Board. 

In 2019, the House of Leaders was conceptualised, bringing together student leaders from the CCA, the House and Active Citizenship Education.

The Digital Citizenship was added to the boards in 2023, bringing the total number of boards to six.

Under the auspices of the House of Leaders, we aim to nurture and our students discover the leader within. Student leadership development programmes are designed based on the Levels of Service by Donald J. Treffinger.

Through these planned experiential programmes facilitated by mentors (teachers and seniors), student leaders have the opportunities to apply leadership knowledge, skills and understanding in leading self, peers and the community.
