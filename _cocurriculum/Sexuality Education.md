<h3>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</h3>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education
(SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand the physiological,
social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy
and rewarding relationships with others, including those with members of
the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the
basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages
and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching
and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the
different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of
Sexuality Education are to:</p>
<p>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;<strong>Key messages</strong>&nbsp;of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
the foundation for strong families);&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Sexuality Education Lessons</h5>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values and attitudes
of our youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers,
exposure to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is
a complex stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his or her own
identity and often struggles with new social relationships. The period
of middle adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent
period for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive
maturity may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various
activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding
the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The
need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong and&nbsp;hinder one’s
ability to act responsibly. Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent
from within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong
sense of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible
consequences of sexual behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>7. Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary students will have
the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their character,
and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to deal with various
issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern at this age.</p>
<h5>At School Of Science &amp; Technology, Singapore, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in&nbsp;2025:</h5>

<h5>eTeens Programme</h5>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>eTeens </em>is
a programme developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with
the Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate
information on STIs, HIV and protection from a health perspective. <em>eTeens </em>is
conducted in two segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme.
The desired outcome of the <em>eTeens </em>programme is that students are
empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are taught
skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say “no”
to sex and negative peer pressure.&nbsp; They also learn that the impact
of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves their family, and the
importance of responsible decision-making and seeking help. Abstinence
and upholding family values are the key messages.</p>
<p><strong>At School Of Science &amp; Technology, Singapore, the&nbsp; eTeens &nbsp;programme will be implemented as follows in 2025:</strong>
