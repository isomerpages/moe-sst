#### Digital Citizenship Framework

In SST, Digital Citizenship is Applied Cyber Wellness. To be actively applied and become competent digital citizens, we are seeking to be authentic and community-focused.

We believe that

###### Digital Citizenship promotes Cyber Wellness
Good digital citizens maintain awareness of the dangerous aspects of using social technology and advocate good behaviours to protect themselves and others online.

###### Digital Citizenship balances personal empowerment and community well-being
Good digital citizens know that the online environment offers many ways to access information, create content, work collaboratively, and consume knowledge. Our ability to influence others in our community has increased multifold. Hence, we need to interact with online resources respectfully and ethically.

###### Digital Citizenship requires ongoing community participation 

Good digital citizens are willing to debate and revise our understanding of the impact of digital technology and seek to positively promote thoughtful and empathetic intentions to advance humanityâ€™s interests.

#### Digital Citizenship Programmes

The Digital Citizenship Committee oversees the various programmes and carries them out with the Digital Citizenship Leadership Board (DCB) and Digital Citizenship Representatives (DCRs) from each class.

###### DC Parents Engagement
We conduct talks and workshops on Educational Technology and ICT for parents to build a united community on our approach towards developing digital citizens.
