The Active Citizenship Education (ACE) curriculum plays a pivotal role in fostering SSTudents to become local and global active citizens who contribute to the betterment of the community through,

*   advocating positive social action and serving the community with purpose and enthusiasm;   
    
*   displaying the attributes that will allow them to take advantage of the myriad of opportunities abroad;  
    
*   seeking to interact with and learn from people from diverse cultural backgrounds;                                                      
*   developing respect and empathy for others.

With the vision of developing a community engaged in active citizenship and being transformed by service-learning, the ACE committee leads a 4 year ACE curriculum for every SSTudent to undergo applied learning experiences in the area of Service Learning, National Education Cultural exchanges with SST’s overseas educational partners and on. 

The most passionate SStudents can look forward to taking up the challenge of being ACE student leaders, who guide and role-model the competencies of an Active local and global citizen to the SST community. 

Through experiential learning and reflective practice across numerous local service projects in partnership with local organisations such as Heartware Network, and Singapore Cancer Society or through collaborations with our international partners through the Learning Alliance Beyond Borders programme, the ACE curriculum develops Citizenship, Cross-cultural understanding and Courage from SST’s 10Cs. 

Being a school that forges ahead in educational technologies, the ACE Student Leaders also seeks to engage the community in advocating for social good through their Instagram account SST-Actvocates at [https://www.instagram.com/sstactvocates/](https://www.instagram.com/sstactvocates/)
