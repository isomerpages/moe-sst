SST Athletics provides athletes the opportunity to grow and excel in the sport. The training programme provides students the opportunities to hone their athleticism in their areas of strength (long-distance/ short distance events). Through the experiences in participating in national competitions, athletes are able to experience for themselves the true meaning behind resilience and sportsmanship. 

Besides providing athletes with physical training, they are also taught to hone and develop their intellectual and interpersonal skills;  that are applicable to their future endeavours.
