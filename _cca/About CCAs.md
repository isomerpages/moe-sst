<h4>CCAs</h4>
<p>SST believes in values-based education with a holistic approach that will
nurture graduates of exceptional character.</p>
<p>CCAs inculcate sound moral values in our students while providing the
platform for building personal character and fostering interpersonal skills.
They cultivate healthy living habits, strengthen the creative and innovative
spirit, and promote aesthetic and cultural appreciation. SST students shine
in a diverse range of mixed and sometimes eclectic fields in which our
students can innovatively synthesise and showcase their talents. These
achievements are a testament to their dedication towards maximising their
potential in their areas of interest through their CCAs, as well as their
academic pursuits.</p>
<p>Below are the range of CCAs at SST.</p>
