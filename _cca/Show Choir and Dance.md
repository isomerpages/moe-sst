Show Choir and Dance began as a passionate student-initiated interest group in 2011. Individuals of diverse backgrounds came together with a singular vision: to enliven the SST community by sharing their love for performance. This initiative was officially recognised and established as a core performing arts CCA in 2013.

The CCA comprises two distinct arms. The Show Choir focuses on high-energy artistic performances that seamlessly combine choral singing with complex choreography, while the Dance Crew delves into the techniques of groovy street dance. Each arm immerses members in a unique artistic discipline, providing a dedicated environment to discover their creative potential. By delving deep into the nuances of their chosen art form, students are encouraged to experiment, innovate, and master its distinct expressions.

Driven by a spirit of innovation, the CCA actively participates in a wide variety of competitions to challenge our members. We pride ourselves on constantly exploring new themes and venturing into fresh competitive arenas. These opportunities allow our members to adapt to different styles, refining their showmanship and artistic expressions on diverse stages.

This rigorous exposure broadens our members’ artistic repertoire and builds them into confident individuals who strive to be dynamic and unconventional leaders, ready to make a positive impact in the future.
