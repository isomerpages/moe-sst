Show Choir and Dance started off as an interest group in 2011. Individuals of diverse backgrounds came together and decided to enliven the SST community by sharing their passion in singing and dancing. It was later recognised and officiated as one of the performing arts CCA in 2013.

The Show Choir and Dance consists of two arms; show choir and dance crew. Show choir focuses on artistic performances that combine choral singing along with choreography. Dance crew, on the other hand, delves into groovy street dance performances. Since its founding years, both arms have, on occasions, come together to produce musical productions which gained recognition of peers in the fraternity.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic inhibited performing opportunities, it paved the way for innovative curriculum such as music video productions to support physical and online school events, a venture that integrated affordances of technology into creative pieces. As safety measures eased, opportunities for live performances resurfaced, allowing our members to once again develop and display their showmanship and artistic expressions.

The commitment to produce passionate and excellent performers not only broadens our members’ artistic repertoire, but also builds them up to be confident individuals who strive to be dynamic and unconventional leaders in time to come.
