<p>The Applied Research Club (ARC@SST) provides a platform for passionate
and capable applied research students to develop their skills and grow
their potential to tackle real-world issues through science and technology.
A rapidly growing community, ARC@SST brings together our best applied research
talent to discuss, collaborate and act on applied research problems together.
We also emphasise the transmission of applied science and technology information
through actively engaging the school community and the public via exciting
demonstrations, workshops and multimedia channels. These experiences lay
the path for a rich experience for its members, encouraging and enabling
them to excel in science competitions and fairs at both the national and
international levels.</p>
<p>Ultimately, ARC@SST aims to nurture young applied scientists who are critical,
confident and creative innovators. They are also active citizens who can
collaborate across different cultural contexts for the betterment of society.</p>
