Enrichment activities and exposure to competitions, such as the SYFC Inter-School Aeromodelling Competition (SIAC) and the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition, provide meaningful learning opportunities and broaden students’ horizons. Beyond aviation, the CCA emphasises values education, resilience, and leadership, equipping members with qualities essential for success in diverse fields. SYFC inspires students to pursue excellence, explore potential aviation careers, and develop character through teamwork and responsibility.
