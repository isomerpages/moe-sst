The Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC) provides programmes and activities to nurture our members’ passion for aviation and develop them to be creative problem-solvers and dynamic leaders who will serve in the various fields of aviation. Through workshops and competitions, our members gain more knowledge and experience in aviation. These create meaningful learning experiences.

In 2020 till early 2022, despite the presence of Covid-19, our CCA sessions continued in the form of eCCA and physical ones. With the ability to adapt, our members went through the CCA sessions and honed their skills in Flight Simulation. Besides that, SYFC has been able to expose its members to various competitions such as the Flight Simulation Competition@HQ, Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition and Drone Odyssey Challenge. In such challenging times, the SYFC members continues to persevere and embrace the new normal.
