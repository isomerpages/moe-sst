SST fencing provides ample opportunities for its members to learn the fundamental skills of fencing in a fun and engaging way. With the help of both dedicated teachers and experienced coaches, we strive to equip our fencers with the basic skills of fencing so that they can engage in the lifelong pursuit of excelling in fencing as a sport. We also provide opportunities for talented fencers to represent the school as a team in the Zonal and National Competitions. Through fencing, we aim to inculcate the school values of teamwork, respect, perseverance and self-discipline in our fencers.

Some people have the misconception about fencing as a sport with no physical intensity, and thus not a real sport. However, we would like to change that perspective. In fact, fencing is an incredibly physical and tiring sport. It takes a lot of muscle to fence, and a lot of stamina to keep going all the way through a match. Fencing is also commonly associated with a fast-paced game of chess, where the fencer is constantly thinking of what to do in milliseconds in order to defeat the opponent. In fact in Olympic fencing, fencing movements are so fast and precise where an attack may match up to the speed of a fast pitch softball. 

All in all, we hope that you have gained a better understanding of what fencing entails. If you think you have what it takes to be a great fencer, come join us! We hope to see you soon.
