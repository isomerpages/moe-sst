Robotics @APEX started in 2010 with a small group of students. Guided by the 3 operative values - Effective, Efficient and Exemplary and with the dedication of students and staff, the club scaled new heights year after year, establishing its reputation in the local and international robotics communities.  

Members gain comprehensive exposure to versatile open-source platforms, including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32, which are often integrated with advanced computer vision systems such as OpenCV. We empower our students to test their technical mastery in prestigious local and international competitions, including the National Robotics Competition, World Robot Olympiad, RoboCup, RoboRAVE International, and VEX Robotics.

Students are also encouraged to embark on ambitious creative projects and apply their knowledge of robotics systems to solve complex real-world problems, moving beyond standard kits to build original and functional engineering solutions. This pursuit of excellence through both competitive rigour and interest-driven research hones the resilience, perseverance, critical thinking, and project management skills essential for lifelong success. By mastering industry-standard hardware and software, our members develop a sophisticated, future-ready toolkit that prepares them to lead and innovate in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
