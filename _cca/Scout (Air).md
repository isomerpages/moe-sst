*   nurture scouts through fun-filled and exciting scouting activities that will enable them to discover, learn and put into practice essential life skills.

The Scout programme in SST is an aviation and outdoor-oriented education programme that aims to inculcate discipline, leadership and teamwork qualities in scouts through an informal education process. The programme also aims to foster the active commitment of scouts to the spiritual values of life, to society and oneself.

Using the Scout Method, every scout is empowered to be the principal agent of his/her development as a self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed person. Every programme/activity is planned to encourage individuals to be actively involved in and be responsible for their own development. The Scout programme supports the values and character education in SST.
