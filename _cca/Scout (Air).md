The Scout programme in SST is an aviation- and outdoor-focused youth development programme that nurtures disciplined, resilient and service-oriented young people. Through experiential learning and the Scout Method, scouts develop leadership, teamwork and responsibility by actively taking ownership of their growth.

Guided by the Scout Promise and Law, scouts learn through hands-on challenges, small-group (patrol) collaboration and community service. The programme shapes self-reliant, morally grounded individuals who are committed to serving others and contributing meaningfully to society, while complementing SST’s character and citizenship education.
