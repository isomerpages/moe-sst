The SST Basketball team is a group of talented and dedicated teenagers, who strive to reach their full potential on the court. With hard work and determination, they strive to be the team to beat in the National School Games, West Zone Basketball league every season.

The team is a mix of experienced seniors and rising stars, who work together to bring out the best in each other. The players have developed strong bonds both on and off the court, making them a close-knit and supportive team.

The SST basketballers display impressive athleticism and skillful ball-handling skills on the court, where they give their all in every game. Whether they are making fast-paced transitions on offense or working tirelessly on defense, they never give up a play, making their opponents work hard for each point.

The Co-Curricular teachers, led by Mr Liu Yi Jie, assisted by Mr Jerome Tan, Mr Karlson Goh, and special advisor, Mr Stanley Tan, has collaborated closely with the coach, Mr Teo, to bring out the best in these young men and women, moulding them into a well-oiled basketball team. We push ourselves hard, during both training and competition, to remain on track towards our goal of winning every match we participate in.

The saying ‘Tough times don't last, but tough people do’ reflects the SST Basketball Club's belief that passion and hard work can overcome all obstacles. The team's goal is to make the school proud with their strong sense of sportsmanship, passion, and dedication to the sport. With a strong commitment to teamwork, hard work, and sportsmanship, the SST basketball team strives to embody the best values of the school as model student-athletes.
