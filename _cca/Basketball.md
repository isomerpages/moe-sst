The SST Basketball team is a group of talented and dedicated teenagers, who strive to reach their full potential on the court. With hard work and determination, they strive to be the team to beat in the National School Games, West Zone Basketball league every season.

The team is a mix of experienced seniors and rising stars, who work together to bring out the best in each other. The players have developed strong bonds both on and off the court, making them a close-knit and supportive team.
