At SST, the Football CCA is much more than just a sport. It is a time and place where our student-athletes work hard and play hard, pushing themselves both physically and mentally to achieve greatness. Our team is a tight-knit group of players who support each other through thick and thin, helping each other to reach their full potential.

Our experienced coaches not only train our players to develop their skills on the field, but also instil important values like self-discipline and good behaviour. They are dedicated to helping each student become a better version of themselves and reach their full potential.

On the field, our players are fierce competitors who play with respect and determination. They give their all, striving for victory while treating their opponents with the utmost respect. Our Football CCA is designed to help our young players grow, excel, and become future leaders in society.
