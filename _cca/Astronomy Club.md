The Astronomy Club started in 2013 with a small group of students. Over the years, the club grew from strength to strength to the current size, a choice CCA amongst the members of the SST community.   

The club engages members in various activities; from talks to field trips to competitions and community outreach. In the Astronomy Club, one must teach to be a leader. The process of instructing or sharing develops the student leaders to be strong science communicators. The club develops the following skills: Collaboration, Communication, Curiosity, Critical Thinking, and Creative Thinking.  

The phrases “Ad Astra” and “See the BIG picture” encapsulates the aspirations of the club in developing members who are ready for the world.
