The Astronomy Club began in 2013 with a small group of students and has since grown into one of SST’s most sought-after CCAs. Members engage in talks and workshops, stargazing and telescope-handling sessions, sky-observation logs, and astrophotography (from planning to post-processing). They also take part in field trips and learning journeys, research groups, and space-data analysis projects that strengthen evidence-based reasoning. For students who enjoy challenge, the club provides structured competition training and participation.

A defining feature of the club is leadership through teaching: student leaders facilitate sessions, mentor juniors, and communicate science clearly. With the addition of a school Observatory and Radio Station (for radio-astronomy learning and outreach), members will have even more authentic platforms to explore and serve.

#### Achievements/ Milestones

  **FCC Radio License**
	
Since November 2023, our FCC Radio Licensing program has demonstrated consistent growth and success. Beginning with an initial cohort of 6 licensed participants, the program expanded significantly in 2024 with 21 successful certifications, followed by an additional 10 students earning their licenses in 2025. To date, the initiative has empowered 37 individuals to achieve their official radio credentials.
