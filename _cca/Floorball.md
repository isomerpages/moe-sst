The SST Boys’ Floorball team, established in 2013, participates in a fast-paced indoor sport that requires physical stamina, quick decision-making, and strong teamwork. 

Through intensive weekly training, players develop resilience, strategic awareness, and core values such as integrity, solidarity, and sportsmanship. After a two-year hiatus due to COVID-19, both the B and C Division teams returned to the National School Games in 2022, gaining valuable competitive experience and strengthening team cohesion. The team’s dedication and perseverance led to a historic milestone in 2024, when the C Division secured 2nd place in the NSG League 2 Finals for the first time. 

Beyond competition, floorball provides students with a meaningful platform to forge lasting friendships and hone essential 21st-century competencies, preparing them for future challenges both on and off the court.
