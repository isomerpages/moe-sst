In SST, our Boys’ Floorball team was set up in 2013. Floorball is an indoor team sport played by three to five players and one goalkeeper per team. It is a fast-paced and adrenaline pumping sport that requires not only physical stamina but also a strategic mind. 

Floorball teaches important values such as solidarity, non-discrimination and integrity. Weekly training sessions are intensive, but our boys enjoy being challenged to make quick strategic decisions during the game. They forge strong bonds and ever-lasting friendships. 

After a 2 year hiatus due to Covid 19, our B and C Division team finally had the chance to participate in the National School Games (NSG) Competition 2022. While preparing and striving through the different matches, the team forged stronger team spirit, better communication and tactical skills. Though we did not progress further in the competition, the team gained invaluable experience. The team will continue to strive for excellence in future competitions and display great sportsmanship.

Through the sport, our boys also have another platform to hone their 21st-century competencies to prepare them for the future.
