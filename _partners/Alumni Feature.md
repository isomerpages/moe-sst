<p><strong>Erica Seah (Alumna, Class of 2024):</strong>
</p>
<p>It is an honour for the SST to celebrate Erica Seah (Class of 2024, S4-02)
for her receipt of the prestigious Lee Kuan Yew Award for All- Round Excellence
in 2025. The pinnacle national award recognises Erica's exemplary character,
steadfast leadership, and deep-seated commitment to serving others, qualities
she demonstrated throughout her time at SST from 2021 - 2024.</p>
<p>During her time as the Chairperson of the Student Council, Erica embodied
the very best of SST's values. Her journey reflects a remarkable display
of resilience and humility, overcoming challenges with grace while inspiring
her peers to do the same. Whether leading initiatives or supporting her
fellow students, she demonstrated an unwavering dedication to enriching
the lives of the SST community.</p>
<p>Erica's achievement is more than a personal milestone; it is an inspiration
to every student and staff member at SST. It stands as a testament to the
fact that holistic excellence, in academics, leadership, and service, is
a truly noble pursuit. As she embarks on her next chapter in SJI, the SST
community celebrates her well-deserved success and looks forward to seeing
her continued positive impact in Singapore and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Stick ’Em Wins the 2025 Hult Prize:</strong>
</p>
<p>A big congratulations to Chong Ing Kai and Tew Jing An (SST Alumni, Class
of 2019), and their co-founder Adam Huh Dam, whose education technology
start-up Stick ’Em was crowned the global champion of the Hult Prize 2025
Finals in London, often hailed as the “Nobel Prize for students”. The team
clinched US$1 million in seed funding to scale their impact in reshaping
STEAM learning worldwide.</p>
<p>Competing against over 200,000 participants from 130 countries and 15,000
teams, Stick ’Em rose to the top with a mission to make hands-on learning
accessible and fun for all.</p>
<p>The idea began humbly in 2020, chopsticks, geometric connectors, and plug-and-play
electronics forming a simple yet powerful toolkit for students to prototype
and learn through play. “Tinkering is messy, creative, and spontaneous,”
they said. “We wanted kids to focus on exploring, not worrying about breaking
things.” Armed with takeaway chopsticks, a second-hand 3D printer, and
an Arduino board, they built their first working model, a minimal viable
product tested with friends and refined over time into a polished STEAM
kit now used in classrooms.</p>
<p>After advancing through an online incubator, the team joined 23 others
at Ashridge House for a month-long Global Accelerator. In Week 3, they
pitched at Google’s London HQ, earning a spot among the top eight global
finalists. At the Grand Finals, their light-hearted yet heartfelt pitch
captivated judges and they emerged victorious.</p>
<p>Five years of passion, perseverance, and purpose culminated in this moment
for our alumni, Chong Ing Kai and Tew Jing An, a testament to SST’s spirit
of Transforming Learning, Impacting Society.

<br>“I think it's very important to think very hard about where you're at,
the privilege that you have even being in SST, the resources that you have,
the great teachers they have around you. And if you have an idea, just
go and pursue it. Go try it. If you fail, you fail. If you don't fail,
think of all the upside you could get from that.” - Ing Kai
<br>
<br>“Now is the best time to explore these ideas, because even if you fail,
you still have a backup, which is just going to school like a normal person,
but if you succeed, you will maybe see things that you haven't seen before,
try things that you haven't and have, most importantly, have a great story
to share to someone next time.” - Jing An</p>
