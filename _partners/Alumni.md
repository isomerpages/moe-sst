#### SST Alumni Association
![SSTlogo](/images/Logo_SSTAlumni__4___latest_.png)

We stay connected with our fellow alumni and are proud to say that they have contributed to the SST community in many ways. They are indeed an inspiration to their juniors across various batches. The school is honoured to celebrate their achievements and provide support for their goals.


The SST Alumni Association (SSTAA) was established in 2020 with the following objectives:

*   To foster and perpetuate a sense of community
    
*   To connect past & present batches of SST students
    
*   To support the development of SST
    

With 1000 members and 3 successful major events to date, SSTAA looks forward to continued engagement with SST alumni and SST to achieve its objectives.


#### Past Events
#### Homecoming 2022

SSTAA successfully organised our inaugural SST Homecoming event on 26 August 2022, inviting alumni from the 2013-2021 batches to return to SST. The event was warmly received, with over 500 alumni gathering to reconnect with old friends and teachers. The event featured captivating performances by both alumni and current students, adding to the festive atmosphere. As the largest event organised by SSTAA thus far, it marked a significant milestone for our fledgling organisation.

Building on the success of Homecoming 2022, Homecoming 2024 was held on 3 February 2024. During the night of fun and activities, more than 300 alumni had the opportunity to bond over shared memories and experiences.
