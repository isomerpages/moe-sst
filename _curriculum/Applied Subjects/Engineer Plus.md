The World Economic Forum believes that connected devices will outnumber people worldwide. These electronic devices, commonly known as the internet of things (IoT), come in many forms and applications. By 2025, the number of IoT devices is projected to exceed 40 billion, fuelled by continued technological advances and the plummeting costs of computing, storage and connectivity to spread to all aspects of daily life.

Programming is a must for every Electronics Engineering field except hardware design field. But knowing programming will help the hardware engineer also to create hardware better. IoT requires engineers who can manage the confluence of electronics and programming.

Computational thinking is a set of skills that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways that a computer could execute. Increasingly, the SST alumni have reiterated to the school on the importance of programming and computational thinking in augmenting their university specialisations. External scans with students from UCLA Berkeley, Stanford and even the local universities have further validated the value of SST offering Engineering+ (Electronics and Computing) as a course option.
