The Biotechnology course is a multi-disciplinary science that engages knowledge in biology and technological applications to improve human lives and the environment.

The subject uses knowledge from a variety of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, bioinformatics, genetic engineering and manufacturing processes. Biotechnology is distinct from biology - while biology studies basic processes of living organisms, biotechnology is the application of biology to solve problems and improve lives.

Students will learn principles and applications of various areas of biotechnology such as cell culture technology, microbial biotechnology and recombinant DNA technology. This subject helps students develop good laboratory skills and a research mindset. It also provides students with the foundation for further studies in biotechnology, biomedical science and other related fields.

In the course of the study, there are enrichment programmes that extend learning beyond the curriculum. This includes industrial visits and talks by experts from different research institutes or local biotech start-up companies. Students also have the chance to apply their knowledge and skills learnt in work`shops for real-world applications.
