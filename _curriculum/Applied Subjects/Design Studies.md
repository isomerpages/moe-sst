The Design Studies Applied Subject introduces students into greater depth, the process of design thinking and general design processes as well as the three design disciplines of visual communication design (VCD), interior and exhibition space design (IESD), and architectural design (AD). It aims to nurture an awareness and appreciation of the relationships between design, humanities, art, technology, business, culture and economic development through authentic and practical performance tasks that will allow students to directly apply what they have learned.

In addition, students will develop creative and innovative mindsets, critical thinking and analytical skills through design activities; and acquire the ability to critique design works and generate creative design solutions. Students will also develop competencies in visual and oral expression and communication, as well as digital design techniques for presenting design concepts more aesthetically and effectively. The performance tasks also aims to sharpen the studentsâ€™ skillsets in project and time management, heighten their confidence and seed in them a sense of efficacy and purpose when working on their designs to resolve the given briefs.
