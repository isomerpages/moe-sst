The Design Studies Applied Subject delves deeper into the subject matter, introduces the process of design thinking and general design processes, as well as the three design disciplines of visual communication design (VCD), interior and exhibition space design (IESD), and architectural design (AD). 

Through authentic and practical performance tasks, the Design Studies Applied Subject aims to nurture an awareness and appreciation of the relationship between design, humanities, art, technology, business, culture and economic development. This approach enables students to directly apply their acquired knowledge and skills.

In addition, students will develop creative and innovative mindsets, critical thinking and analytical skills through design activities; and acquire the ability to critique design works and generate creative design solutions. Students will also develop competencies in visual and oral expression and communication, as well as digital design techniques for presenting design concepts more aesthetically and effectively. The performance tasks also aim to sharpen the studentsâ€™ skill sets in project and time management, heighten their confidence and seed in them a sense of efficacy and purpose when working on their designs to resolve the given briefs.
