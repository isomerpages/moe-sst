SST offers a range of O-Level applied subjects to cater to different interests, and these subjects are recognised for admission to Junior Colleges or Polytechnics.

The O-Level applied subjects offered in SST are: Biotechnology, Computing+, Design Studies and Electronics. Students can also opt to take up two applied subjects, Computing + and Electronics, under the Engineering+ programme. SST remains committed to expanding its range of applied subjects and will work closely with MOE and tertiary partners to offer other applied subjects in years to come.
