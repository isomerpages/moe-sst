The Electronics module introduces students to the study of electronics engineering through the application of scientific knowledge of electricity and electronics, and to solve authentic engineering problems using the engineering design process.
 
These authentic engineering experiences encourage students to be innovative, take calculated risks and persevere to reach a workable solution. The process provides opportunities for students to think critically, evaluate information and communicate effectively.

Students will apply their knowledge of the science of electricity and electronic components to design and build electronic systems that can solve daily problems. The students will also develop testing and troubleshooting skills. Through these learning experiences, the subject should provide a broad-based foundation for further studies in electronics engineering and related fields.
