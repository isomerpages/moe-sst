The Computing+ course in SST equips students with computational thinking techniques and creativity to analyse and solve problems. Computational thinking is a problem-solving process involving analysis, pattern finding, abstraction and algorithmic design. Students use these processes to develop programmes to deal confidently with complex and open-ended problems. 

Students who learn Computing can apply the thinking skills across the curriculum and begin to see a relationship between subjects as well as real-life applications beyond the classroom. Students also develop skills to handle and process data in computer systems, as well as understand the need to be ethical when dealing with data.

Students from SST are further challenged through the introduction of additional (+) modules, which deepen their understanding and exposure to current technological trends. This provides students with a  strong foundation to take their learning in Computing+ to the next stage in the field of Informatics.
