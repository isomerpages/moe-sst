SST's English Language curriculum emphasises applied learning, with a focus on innovative teaching methods and a commitment to fostering advocacy for a better world. Our approach to language education focuses on building a strong foundation in linguistic and communicative competencies. At SST, we provide a myriad of opportunities for students to showcase their knowledge and skills through authentic experiences, create and represent meaning using various modes of representation, and use language as a vehicle of thought and expression to improve society.   

  

##### Key Programmes/ Events
###### Authentic Learning - the PT way
SStudents get to create and represent meaning using a variety of semiotic modes according to purpose, audience and context..

###### HBL Speaker Series 
  During HBL days, SStudents are given the opportunity to be exposed to trends in society as well as how language is used in the various industries by inviting industry experts to share. Some experts include journalists, editors, social media influencers, a HR professional, and a social worker.

###### Student Congress 
The annual Student Congress aims to inculcate the attitude of advocacy for a better world.  SStudents examine local and global issues, explore the multiple perspectives of the issues and advocate for causes through presentations,  debates, and speakers in a panel discussion.
