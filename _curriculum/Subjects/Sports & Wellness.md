In Sports and Wellness, we aspire for all students to be _Fit For Work, Fit For Play and Fit For Life_. Being fit refers to the ability to function efficiently and effectively at work, to enjoy leisure, to be healthy, and to cope with emergency situations. It encompasses every aspect of health that includes physical, social, emotional and mental well-being. SST aims to develop and build the students' capacity for wellness and fitness to lead a healthy and physical active life.
