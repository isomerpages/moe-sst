The S&W curriculum is based on the philosophy of education through the physical; a multi-dimensional approach to develop students holistically through sports and games excellence. The curriculum engages students actively with relevant activities that help them learn experientially. Lessons are focused on acquiring games skills for sports recreation, uncovering games concepts for understanding, and promoting sportsmanship and sporting behaviour through authentic sports participation and competition. 

Students experience physical, mental and social emotional challenges that effectively develop their strength of character.


#### Outdoor Education

There is also a focus on outdoor education that compels students to develop appropriate outdoor skills and sharpen their coping and management strategies through physical activities while cultivating an attitude of care and appreciation for the environment.

The key concept in the outdoor education programmes is relationship. It creates self-awareness and efficacy, building relationships with self, others and the environment.
