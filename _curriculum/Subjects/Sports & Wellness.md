In Sports and Wellness, we aspire for all students to be Fit For Work, Fit For Play and Fit For Life. Being fit refers to the ability to function efficiently and effectively at work, to enjoy leisure, to be healthy, and to cope with emergency situations. It encompasses every aspect of health that includes physical, social, emotional and mental well-being. SST aims to develop and build the students' capacity for wellness and fitness to lead a healthy and physical active life.

#### Outdoor Education

SST also emphasises on the importance of outdoor education. Key flagship cohort programmes such as the overnight Secondary One Orientation Camp, Outdoor Education Expedition (OEE) for the Secondary 2 and the well-received Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) for the Secondary 3 are put in place to develop resilience and sharpen their coping and management strategies in unfamiliar environments that are out of their comfort zones.

The key concept in the outdoor education programmes is relationship. It creates self-awareness and efficacy, building relationships with self, others and the environment.

#### Sports Education Programme (SEP)
Leveraging the SEP by Sports SG, the school selected target sports and outdoor activities in the programme that cannot be provided by the S&W curriculum within the school. The sports are Archery, Bowling, Rock Climbing and Dragon Boating. For House representatives, certification programmes like the Singapore National Climbing Standard Level 1 and Kayaking 1-Star are also provided for them.
