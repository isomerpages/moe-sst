The SST Science curriculum is based on the philosophy of education through inquiry, experimentation, and discovery. Students are presented with a variety of learning experiences which pique their curiosity about the natural world and help cultivate habits of mind to be out-of-the-box innovators. 

The Science curriculum aims to develop studentsâ€™ scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding; and Science process skills through the disciplines of Biology, Chemistry and Physics. 

The Lower Secondary curriculum comprises six modules: 
* Secondary 1: Health Science, Environmental Science and Transportation Science
* Secondary 2: Investigative Skills in Science (ISS), Communication Science and Materials Science

ISS provides students with the opportunity to be budding scientists or innovators by conducting in-depth studies in an area of their interest. Students who demonstrate passion and aptitude for scientific research continue to develop their projects for showcase and competitions through the Science Talent Development Programme (TDP).
