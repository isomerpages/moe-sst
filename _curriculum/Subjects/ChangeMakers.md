The ChangeMakers Programme for Lower Secondary students is designed to foster an changemaker mindset and innovative attitudes and attributes. The programme combines principles, knowledge, and skills from Art, Design, Media and Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and Information and Communication Technology subjects. Students are taught to apply the SST ChangeMakers process as an essential part of the innovation process to enhance people's lives.

The programme takes students through the various stages of a project, from conceptualisation to market launch, including planning, designing, prototyping, and developing business plans. Additionally, the programme partners with industry professionals to provide students with insights into real-world applications in various areas and offers mentorship for selected projects.

The ChangeMakers Programme offers an integrated learning experience that equips students with essential skills and knowledge needed to succeed in today's innovation-driven economy. By teaching students how to think creatively and critically, design, and develop prototypes, the programme prepares them to face the challenges of the future with confidence. 

The students engage in a collaborative effort to tackle real-world challenges using cardboard modelling and SSTduino, a customised Arduino board developed inhouse by our very own SST students. This culminates in the SST Innofest in secondary one and 3M-SST InnoScience Challenge in secondary two, where the students showcase their innovation.
