“I didn’t know I could learn and enjoy Mathematics too!” is a phrase we often hear in the SST Mathematics classroom. The Mathematics Department aims to develop the 10 competencies and the 3 DNAs (Applied Learning, Integrated Learning and Innovation) of SST as we leverage technology in engaging our students.

Real-world scenarios are presented as performance tasks for students to apply their problem-solving skills. Some examples of authentic integrated learning experiences include:
using Mathematical Modelling to alleviate flooding along the Ulu Pandan Canal;
to grow food quickly for tsunami-affected inhabitants of an island;
to design a solar cooker for earthquake-affected communities on an island;
to model and simulate the spreading of coronavirus.

Students make use of Computational Thinking to formulate solutions to such tasks by breaking down complex problems into simpler, more manageable parts. Students observe patterns in the data and use them to test relationships between variables, as well as draw conclusions about the original task. An example of such a task is the optimisation of the running of an ice cream parlour.


The integration of Computational Thinking and Mathematical Mindset in the SST Mathematics classroom can provide a rich and engaging learning environment for students. Mathematical Mindset is the belief that all students can learn Mathematics to the highest levels. By adopting a growth mindset and focusing on self-reflection, productive struggles and mistakes, students are encouraged to approach Mathematical concepts with confidence and a willingness to take risks. Through collaborative tasks that are designed to be “low floor, high ceiling” by nature, students can develop their critical thinking and creativity. This approach to learning Mathematics not only fosters a love for the subject but also equips students with 21st century competencies.

Students who showcase aptitude and mathematical rigour are also given support to develop their mathematical competencies through project showcases and competition opportunities through the SST Math Talent Development Programme (TDP).
