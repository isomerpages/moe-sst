Language is a communication tool that can be applied in various aspects of life. From daily social bonding with family and friends, appreciation and preservation of culture, to networking with people from foreign countries; bilingual skills ensure that students have a unique advantage in this era of globalisation, as we are surrounded by Malay, Tamil and Mandarin speakers. The rise of major economic powers in the region also has strong signals for our students to be prepared linguistically, and to be more willing to work with their strategic partners in the future, by understanding their language, appreciating their culture and norms and compiling discourses from various perspectives.

The Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) department aims to nurture every student to become a “Global Connecting Architect”, effective in the use of a second language to think, plan, create and communicate so that they can confidently venture beyond our shores to connect with other cultures, and to frame discourse from foreign perspectives.
