Language is a communication tool that can be applied in various aspects of life. From daily social bonding with family and friends, appreciation and preservation of culture, to networking with people from foreign countries; bilingual skills ensure that students have a unique advantage in this era of globalisation, as we are surrounded by Malay, Tamil and Mandarin speakers. The rise of major economic powers in the region also has strong signals for our students to be prepared linguistically, and to be more willing to work with their strategic partners in the future, by understanding their language, appreciating their culture and norms and compiling discourses from various perspectives.

The Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) department aims to nurture every student to become a “Global Connecting Architect”, effective in the use of a second language to think, plan, create and communicate so that they can confidently venture beyond our shores to connect with other cultures, and to frame discourse from foreign perspectives.

##### Chinese Language / 华文
Students are groomed into active learners and effective communicators of Chinese language. They will be able to connect both local and global communities through relevant and creative approaches. 

Here, students create multimedia artefacts ranging from microfilms, animations, documentaries and digital posters in the Chinese language. Authentic learning takes place as they research on societal issues and apply skills learnt in their curriculum through these hands-on tasks.


Through collaborative projects, students research on different topics of interest. Communication skill is one of the key learning objectives they will hone as they participate actively in discussions and field research.
