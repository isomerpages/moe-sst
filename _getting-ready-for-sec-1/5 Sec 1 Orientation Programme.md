#### 5. Sec 1 Orientation Programme

The Sec 1 Orientation Programme 2024 aims to facilitate the ease of transition to a secondary school environment in SST by building a foundation of camaraderie and teamwork amongst students. 

##### Objectives of Orientation 2024

 *   Formally welcome the Secondary One Students into SST
    
*   Enable Secondary One students to have a strong support system as they enter the school
    
*   Enculturate the Secondary One students with the SST culture such as independent learning and being future leaders of self and others
    
*   Provide the platform for Secondary Ones to create long-lasting bonds with their classmates
    
*   Familiarise Secondary Ones with [the Vision, Mission, Values and Goals of SST](https://www.sst.edu.sg/about-sst/SST-Identity/vmvg/) 
    and [the characteristics of an SST student](https://www.sst.edu.sg/about-sst/student-code-of-conduct/)
		
Through the Orientation activities, our SST Student Leaders will share the SST culture, values and characteristics of an SST student with the Secondary Ones. This will give them a sense of belonging as they bond with their peers and Form Teachers. It will help to prepare them with the necessary skills and attitudes for a meaningful and fulfilling journey in SST.

In line with our school’s values and desired outcomes, the theme for Orientation 2024 is: Here we start our journey, with each day an open mind.
