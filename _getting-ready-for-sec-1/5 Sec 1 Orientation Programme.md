<h3>5. Sec 1 Orientation Programme</h3>
<p>The Sec 1 Orientation Programme 2026 aims to facilitate the ease of transition
to a secondary school environment in SST by building a foundation of camaraderie
and teamwork amongst students.</p>
<p>Through the Orientation activities, our SST Student Leaders will share
the SST culture, values and characteristics of an SST student with the
Secondary Ones. This will give them a sense of belonging as they bond with
their peers and Form Teachers. It will help to prepare them with the necessary
skills and attitudes for a meaningful and fulfilling journey in SST.</p>
