<p>Through the Orientation activities, our SST Student Leaders will share
the SST culture, values and characteristics of an SST student with the
Secondary Ones. This will give them a sense of belonging as they bond with
their peers and Form Teachers. It will help to prepare them with the necessary
skills and attitudes for a meaningful and fulfilling journey in SST.</p>
<p>In line with our schoolâ€™s values and desired outcomes, the theme for Orientation
2025 is: Here we start our journey, with each day an open mind.</p>
