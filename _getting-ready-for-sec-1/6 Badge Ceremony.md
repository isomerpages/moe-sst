<h3>6. Badge Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Badge Ceremony will be held on 12 January 2024 (Friday). Parents are
invited to join the experience at 5:30 - 8:30 pm in SST.</p>
<p>At SST, we believe parents are our partners in creating meaningful learning
experiences for our students. The Badge Ceremony is an important day in
the life of Secondary 1 Students as it marks the day they are formally
inducted into the SST community. The ceremony will be held in school for
both students and parents.</p>
<p>During this ceremony, students will be presented with their school badges.
We believe that your presence at the SST’s Badge Ceremony on 12 January
2024 (Friday) will provide greater encouragement for your child/ward to
be engaged in their learning at SST.</p>
<p>An online invitation link will be sent to you via Parents’ Gateway for
you to indicate your attendance. Please look out for it closer to the date.</p>
