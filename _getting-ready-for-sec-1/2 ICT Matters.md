<h3>2. ICT Matters For Students And Parents</h3>
<h4>2.1 Sec 1 ICT Pre-School Engagement</h4>
<p>We have curated some informative technology videos and activities to prepare
students for the upcoming technology lessons at SST. We encourage all students
to watch these videos and register for the “Today at Apple” workshops at
their own pace to familiarise themselves with the technology that is used
in SST.</p>
<p>Please access the package here. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTY5gHDVH9fs57HdT7-t22u3zxYtgt4e4rNT25b4OLfRNPoPxGtqcuUSsF8NTYfkHyXs8vaEYiilp-G/pub" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LINK</a>)</p>
<h4>2.2 Email Account</h4>
<p>All SST students are assigned an official email account for communication
and access to learning resources during their study. The official email
account will be used for all correspondence between the school and students.</p>
<p>The login information (ID and Password) will be emailed to parents once
available.</p>
<h4>2.3 Students’ Blog</h4>
<p>The students’ blog serves as a platform to communicate announcements and
general information to students.</p>
<p>URL: <a href="http://studentsblog.sst.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://studentsblog.sst.edu.sg/</a>

<p>Students may refer to the blog regularly to keep abreast of school updates.
In addition, students can also download the app “SST Announcer” on their
mobile phones. The app enables updates to be pushed to the users.</p>
